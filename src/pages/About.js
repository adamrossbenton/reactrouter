        <p>
            Truth be told I wanted to do a lot more with this app, but it's been an incredibly busy week for me with work and other stuff and I just ran out of time. I had plans to have the stocks page leverage the API to pull tables of today's biggest gainers, losers, and most actives. Maybe I'll work on it a bit more after the due date. Sorry! :(
